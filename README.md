![htaccess](https://github.com/ishayanabad/IPS-htaccess/assets/171403530/3463f58a-222a-4315-b7c9-100ba723ab86)

This repository contains a carefully crafted `.htaccess` file designed to enhance the security, performance, and overall efficiency of your Apache web server. By leveraging advanced features and directives, this configuration helps ensure your website remains fast, secure, and compliant with best practices.

### Key Features

**Security Enhancements:**
- Prevent access to sensitive files and directories.
- Implement security headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy` to guard against common web vulnerabilities.

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Use `mod_deflate` for compression of textual content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, reducing page load times and bandwidth usage.
- Set expiration headers with `mod_expires` to enable efficient browser caching for various file types.
- Optimize PHP configurations for memory usage, execution time, and input handling. Includes advanced settings for PHP opcode caching and gzip compression.

**HTTPS Enforcement:**
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS to ensure data integrity and confidentiality over the network.

**URL Rewriting:**
- Simplify URL structures for better readability and SEO, and route requests for non-existent files or directories to a default handler.

### Usage

To use this configuration, simply replace or merge it with your existing `.htaccess` file. Ensure that your Apache server has the required modules (`mod_rewrite`, `mod_deflate`, `mod_expires`, `mod_headers`, and `mod_php7`) enabled for these directives to work.
