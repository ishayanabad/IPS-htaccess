# Invision Power Services (IPS) Optimized .htaccess
### Comprehensive .htaccess Configuration for Enhanced Security and Performance

This repository hosts a comprehensive `.htaccess` configuration file designed to maximize the security, performance, and efficiency of your Apache web server. By implementing advanced directives and optimizations, this configuration ensures that your website operates smoothly, remains secure, and adheres to best practices.

### Key Features

**Security Enhancements:**
- **Access Control:** Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories.
- **Security Headers:** Implement headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy` to fortify your site against common web vulnerabilities.

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Compression:** Utilize `mod_deflate` to compress HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other textual content, leading to faster page load times and reduced bandwidth consumption.
- **Caching:** Set proper expiration headers with `mod_expires` to enable efficient browser caching for optimal speed and performance.
- **PHP Optimization:** Fine-tune PHP settings for memory management, execution time, and input processing. Advanced configurations include PHP opcode caching and gzip compression to ensure swift and efficient PHP script execution.

**HTTPS Enforcement:**
- **Secure Connections:** Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS to guarantee your site's data integrity and confidentiality over the network.

**URL Rewriting:**
- **SEO-Friendly URLs:** Simplify URL structures for enhanced readability and SEO benefits. Route requests for non-existent files or directories to a default handler (such as `index.php`) for a seamless user experience.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Replace or Merge:** Integrate this configuration by replacing or merging it with your existing `.htaccess` file.
2. **Require Modules:** Ensure your Apache server has the necessary modules (`mod_php`, `mod_rewrite`, `mod_expires`, `mod_headers`, and `mod_deflate`) enabled to fully leverage these directives.
