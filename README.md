# Invision Power Services (IPS) Optimized .htaccess
### Comprehensive .htaccess Configuration for Enhanced Security and Performance

Welcome to our repository, where we host a customized `.htaccess` file specifically designed to maximize the security and performance of Apache web servers. This configuration incorporates advanced directives to ensure your website operates at peak efficiency, maintains high security standards, and adheres to industry best practices.

### Key Features

**Security Enhancements:**
- **Access Control:** Robust mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive directories and files.
- **Security Headers:** Implementation of critical security headers such as `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy` to protect against common web vulnerabilities and enhance site safety.

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Compression:** Employ `mod_deflate` for compressing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other text-based resources to decrease loading times and conserve bandwidth.
- **Caching:** Apply `mod_expires` to set appropriate expiration headers, facilitating effective browser caching.
- **PHP Optimization:** Optimize PHP settings including memory usage, execution time, and input processing, utilizing techniques like PHP opcode caching and gzip compression to boost performance.

**HTTPS Enforcement:**
- **Secure Connections:** Ensure all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS, securing your websiteâ€™s data integrity and privacy.

**URL Rewriting:**
- **SEO-Friendly URLs:** Construct simple and clean URL structures that improve both usability and search engine visibility. Automatically route requests for non-existent pages to a designated handler like `index.php`.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Integration:** Directly replace or merge this `.htaccess` configuration with your existing file.
2. **Module Requirements:** Verify that required Apache modules (`mod_php`, `mod_rewrite`, `mod_expires`, `mod_headers`, `mod_deflate`) are enabled.
